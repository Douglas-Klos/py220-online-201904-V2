# Lesson 07

## Parallel Processing

I had during lesson06 started working on a multiprocess version of the program.
I have completed it and included it here with the requested lesson05 code
changes.

Following is the directory layout for the assignment:

<pre>
assignment/
   ├─── l05/ - root program folder
   │      ├─── data/ - csv files
   │      ├─── src/ - module code
   │      └─── tests/ - pytest files
   └─── l06/ - root program folder
          ├─── data/ - .zip of dataset.csv file
          └─── src/ - module code
</pre>
