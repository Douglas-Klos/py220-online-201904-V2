Seriously, for future version of this class, don't leave a README.md file that just says 'placeholder'.  There is content for this activity, include it in the activity folder, or, at the very least, inside this default README, include a link to where the activity files to be downloaded.  This isn't the first week we've had an empty 'placeholder' README.  It makes the class feel incomplete or like they rushed putting the course together.

This activity content has been lifted from:
